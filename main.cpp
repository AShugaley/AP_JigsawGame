/*
 
 so essentially we have
 
 jigSaw input+output to files
 jigSaw algo
 
 algo will be implemented as a CLASS, which can then be inherited by better versions of the algo
 
 input/output in a class, represent the game by a set of jigsawElem's

 
 
 the basic game flow will be implemented in a seperate file (gameFlow) - this will include functions for all basic flows (starting from one). This function or set of functions will be resposible for, you know, the event loop
 
 
 
 so-> main calles gameFlow -> calles input, AI, output. 
 
 in the future -> a new AI inhereting from the current one, a new game flow (just one func)
