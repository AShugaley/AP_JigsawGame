/*
 
 
 there are 3 different errors:
 
 1. input file format - cannot be open/missing ID's/too many ID's/wrong format
        this is checked at the constructor, verify by isInitialized()
 
 
 2. puzzle has no solution - not enough edges, missing coreners, sum != 0
        this is checked in isLegalPuzzle()
 
 
 3. puzzle has no solution - our algorithem did not find one
        this is checked in solveGame
 
 all three parts will write their output directly to stdout
